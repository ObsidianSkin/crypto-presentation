# crypto-presentation
two sample problems

For this one we’ll focus on two very similar examples. In the first one, we’ll look at a single hex string which has been encoded with some character value (0-255). We’ll need to find the right key and output the plaintext. To quickly sort through all possible plaintext iterations, we’ll use a little statistical analysis to find the most likely message.
The second example is exactly the same except now we have a file full of strings and must find which string hides a secret message among a list of meaningless ones.
